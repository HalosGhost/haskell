My goal with this repository, is to eventually become proficient in Haskell.
To do that, I'm going to start with a few very small, very simple projects and then work up to much more complicated ones.

Of course, with the bit of dephell that Haskell has, I am not sure how long I will be able to stick with it.

Additionally, since a friend of mine (besenwesen) introduced me to an awesome benchmarking tool called `criterion <http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/tutorial.html>`_, I've felt a strong urge to test it.
I would not be surprised if I start adding benchmarks to many portions of my code.

Below is my tentative plan for projects:

To Do
-----

- [X] Hello, World!
- [X] FizzBuzz
- [-] Happy Sequence / Happy tester
- [ ] Collatz Conjecture tester
- [ ] Fibonacci Generator (Fast fibs algorithm)
- [ ] ``hr`` implementation
- [ ] Basic ``echo`` or ``cat``
- [ ] Something with ncurses
